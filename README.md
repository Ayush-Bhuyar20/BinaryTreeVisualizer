# 🌳 Binary Tree Visualizer with Traversal Animation

This is a Java Swing-based application that allows users to **visualize a binary tree** and **animate its traversals** (preorder, inorder, postorder). 

It’s designed to help students and beginners understand binary tree structures and traversal logic by showing how nodes are visited **step-by-step**.
